Welcome to my personal blog! I am a master student in Data Science at RWTH-Aachen with a focus on deep learning. My interests lie in the intersection of Vision, Language and general Machine Learning. My goal is to share my research findings, thoughts and experiences on the latest developments in the field of machine learning and its applications in computer vision and natural language processing. 

As a researcher, I have been working on various Machine Learning projects and have a strong working knowledge of the field. I have industry experience of more than 3 years in development and deployment of statistical machine learning models in production with end-to-end software development cycle. My current research focuses on developing new techniques for improving the performance of vision and language models. I am also interested in exploring the generalization capabilities of these models and developing methods to improve their robustness.

On this blog, you will find a variety of posts on topics such as natural language processing, computer vision, deep learning, and more. I will also be sharing my thoughts on the latest research papers and the direction of the field. My hope is that my blog will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in Machine Learning, and I welcome any feedback or questions you may have.
